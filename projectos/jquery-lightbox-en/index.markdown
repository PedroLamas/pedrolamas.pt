About
-----

As the name shows, this is just WordPress's version of the jQuery Lightbox Plugin written by balupton, working perfectly with WordPress 2.2 or up, and fully compatible with K2! ;)

Instructions
------------

Just download the plugin, unzip the files to the *wp-content\\plugins* folder and activate the plugin in WordPress options.

Then, every time you want to use the Lightbox effect, just place a link to the image, and add the *rel="lightbox"* attribute to it, in order to activate the effect when the link is clicked. You can also use *rel="lightbox-album"* replacing *album* by a any keyword to group some pictures on an album!

Sample
------

Click the image bellow! :)

HTML code sample:
