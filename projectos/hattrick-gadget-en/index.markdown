This is the first Hattrick Gadget for Windows Sidebar!!

You can seen above the main screen of the Gadget, showing the current Hattrick time, the weather for your region, your team's name and links for the League, Economy and Matches View! Bellow you can find information about the next match your team will be playing, and if the match is ongoing, it shows the live result and the corresponding events!

This is how the Gadget appears when it's docked to the Sidebar. It has the information shown on the main screen, but on a compacted basis!

FAQ
---

**Q:** I've just registered with Hattrick, can I start playing/using the Gadget? **A:** No! You will have to wait for an Hattrick administrator to set you up with a team (you'll be notified by e-mail when that happens) and only then you'll be able to use the Gadget.

**Q:** What is the *Security Code* on the Gadget settings? **A:** The Security Code is used by CHPP applications, and exists to ensure your security. When the CHPP application uses the Security Code to login, it is restricted to "read-only" access and cannot do any harm to your team. You can set your security code on the Hattrick website, on the "Preferences" page.

**Q:** Can I run this Gadget on my Windows XP? **A:** No. YES!!! Just check [here](http://www.joejoe.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=2564) on how to accomplish that! :)
