About

Windows Phone emulator uses a basic skin showing a generic device, but we can find many alternative skins on the internet, like the [Nokia Lumia 710](http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/posts/11-10-26/welcome-nokia-lumia-wp7-emulator-skin.aspx) from [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/), and the [Samsung Focus](http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2011/12/my-new-windows-phone-emulator-theme/) from [Jeff Wilcox](http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/).

Following up on them, I looked for one of the Nokia Lumia 800, but the (many!) skins I found looked quite bad, result of using low resolution images…

So, I created my very own Nokia Lumia 800 skin for Windows Phone emulator, and the result is what you can see below! :)

This skin uses hi-res images, and has the following fully working buttons:

-   Back/App switcher
-   Start/Speech
-   Search
-   Volume Up
-   Volume Down
-   Camera

Note: though the “Power” is present and does the expected animation(!), this doesn't seem to work on the Windows Phone emulator!

Install
-------

Here's what you need to do to use this skin:

-   Make sure the emulator is closed!
-   Open the emulator folder (normally should be something like “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft XDE\\1.0\\”)
-   Create a backup of the “WM7\_Skin.xml” file just in case you want to go back to the old skin
-   Extract the files to the emulator folder (note: requires administrator access)
-   Start the emulator!
