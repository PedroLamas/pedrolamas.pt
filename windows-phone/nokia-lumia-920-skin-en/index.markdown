Following up on my previous [Nokia Lumia 800 skin](windows-phone/nokia-lumia-800-skin-en/) for Windows Phone emulator, I now bring you my very own Nokia Lumia 920 skin, and the result is what you can see below! :)

[![](wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Nokia-Lumia-920-thumb.png "Nokia Lumia 920 skin for Windows Phone Emulator")](wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Nokia-Lumia-920.png)

This skin uses hi-res images, and has the following fully working buttons:

-   Back/App switcher
-   Start/Speech
-   Search
-   Volume Up
-   Volume Down
-   Camera

Note: though the “Power” is present and does the expected animation(!), this doesn't seem to work on the Windows Phone emulator!

Install
-------

Here's what you need to do to use this skin:

-   Make sure the emulator is closed!
-   Open the emulator folder (normally should be something like “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft XDE\\1.0\\”)
-   Create a backup of the “WM7\_Skin.xml” file just in case you want to go back to the old skin
-   Extract the files to the emulator folder (note: requires administrator access)
-   Start the emulator!
